# Disabled-Imposter
A deadly among us imposter, except it only tries to stab you when you're far away, rather than the other way around! :D
Parts-
- A button that does not work (useless)
- A red LED light that turns on when an object moves away from the sensor (the other way around)
- A motor that helps the knife rotate to create a stabbing-motion, when the object moves away form the sensor.
- connecting wires
- bread board
- arduino board
